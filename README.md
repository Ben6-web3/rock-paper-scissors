# rock-paper-scissors

In this first iteration of the project I recreate a five round game of rock-paper-scissors. 

This project is meant to test my knowledge of javascript functions. 
The pieces are simple:

A function that randomizes the computer selection: computerPlay()
A function that plays one round of rock, paper, and scissors and accepts two parameters: playRound(playerSelection, computerSelection)
Within this function I also use the prompt() function to ask the player for their selection. And I keep score.
A function to check the score and declare a winner/loser.
A function to reset the score to zero.
Incorporate the former two functions within game(). I do not use loops as they are not covered yet but invoke the playRound() 5 times. Then check score, and finally reset the score.
